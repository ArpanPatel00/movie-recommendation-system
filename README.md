## Requirements :heavy_check_mark:

To build this project without any errors/issues, the following requirements need to be satisfied:

1. Python version >= 3.8 (Tested on 3.9.16)
2. Install the dependencies from the requirements.txt file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<hr>

## Running in Local :desktop_computer:

Make sure your environment is activated and you're in the project root directory.

Run the following command:

```bash
python manage.py runserver

```

You can now use the command-line interface to search and get movie recommendations based on your input.

Note: This version is script-based and does not include any web interface.

## Model Training :bar_chart:

This system uses a content-based filtering model trained using cosine similarity on movie metadata.

The model uses:
- Movie titles and descriptions
- Cosine similarity between feature vectors

You can modify the dataset (`movies.csv`) and retrain the model using the main script to improve or customize recommendations.
